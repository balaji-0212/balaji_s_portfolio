## üîç How to Verify Fixes Are Working:

After clearing cache, you should see:

### ‚úÖ Projects Page Should Show:

**5 Projects (in this order):**
1. üìä Bank Loan Report Dashboard (with chart icon)
2. üõ°Ô∏è Fault Tolerant Matrix Computation (with shield icon)
3. ‚ö° IoT Smart Energy Meter (with plug icon)
4. üß† Video-Based Emotion Detection (with brain icon)
5. üìà Sales & Profit Dashboard (with Excel icon)

**Should NOT show:**
- ‚ùå OpenWISP Monitoring project
- ‚ùå "View Files" buttons

**Statistics should show:**
- ‚úÖ "5 Major Projects" (not "6+")

---

## üêõ If Still Not Working:

### Check Server is Running:

1. **Look at your terminal/command prompt**
2. **You should see:**
   ```
   Serving HTTP on :: port 8000 (http://[::]:8000/) ...
   ```

3. **If not running, restart:**
   ```
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```

### Verify File Was Updated:

Run this command in a NEW terminal:
```
findstr /C:"OpenWISP" projects.html
```

**Expected result:** No output (file doesn't contain "OpenWISP")

If it shows output, the file wasn't updated. Let me know!

---

## üì∏ What You Should See:

### BEFORE (Old/Cached):
- 6 projects including "OpenWISP Monitoring"
- "View Files" buttons on projects
- No icons on project titles
- Stats show "6+ Major Projects"

### AFTER (New/Fixed):
- 5 projects (no OpenWISP)
- No "View Files" buttons
- Icons on all project titles (üìä üõ°Ô∏è ‚ö° üß† üìà)
- Stats show "5 Major Projects"

---

## üöÄ Quick Test Script:

Try this in **Incognito mode**:

1. Open: `http://localhost:8000/projects.html`
2. Scroll down and count projects
3. Look for "OpenWISP" - should NOT be there
4. Look for "View Files" buttons - should NOT be there
5. Look at project titles - should have icons
6. Scroll to bottom - stats should say "5 Major Projects"

---

## ‚úÖ Once Cache is Cleared:

**Report back with:**
- How many projects you see (should be 5)
- Whether OpenWISP is gone (should be YES)
- Whether "View Files" buttons are gone (should be YES)
- Whether icons appear on titles (should be YES)

**TRY INCOGNITO MODE FIRST - IT'S THE EASIEST! üéØ**

**Press: Ctrl + Shift + N (Chrome/Edge) or Ctrl + Shift + P (Firefox)**
**Then go to: http://localhost:8000/projects.html**
