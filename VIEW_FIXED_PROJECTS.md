# üéØ VIEW FIXED PROJECTS PAGE - CACHE BYPASS

## ‚ö†Ô∏è ISSUE: Browser Cache

Your browser is showing **OLD cached content**. The fixes ARE applied in the file, but your browser hasn't loaded the new version.

---

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION: Use Cache-Bypass URL

### Method 1: Use Special Test Page (EASIEST)

**Open this URL in your browser:**
```
http://localhost:8000/test_projects.html
```

This page will:
1. Show you what fixes were applied
2. Automatically redirect to the fixed projects page
3. Bypass browser cache completely

### Method 2: Use Cache-Busting URL

**Open this URL directly:**
```
http://localhost:8000/projects.html?nocache=1
```

The `?nocache=1` parameter forces your browser to load fresh content.

### Method 3: Incognito/Private Mode

**Fastest manual method:**

1. **Open Incognito window:**
   - Chrome/Edge: Press `Ctrl + Shift + N`
   - Firefox: Press `Ctrl + Shift + P`

2. **Navigate to:**
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/projects.html
   ```

---

## üîç VERIFICATION:

After using any method above, you should see:

### ‚úÖ CORRECT (Fixed Version):
- **5 projects total** (not 6)
- **No OpenWISP project**
- **No "View Files" buttons**
- **Icons on project titles:**
  - üìä Bank Loan Dashboard
  - üõ°Ô∏è Fault Tolerant System
  - ‚ö° IoT Energy Meter
  - üß† Emotion Detection
  - üìà Sales Dashboard
- **Statistics show "5 Major Projects"**

### ‚ùå INCORRECT (Cached Version):
- 6 projects including OpenWISP
- "View Files" buttons present
- No icons on titles
- Statistics show "6+ Major Projects"

---

## üöÄ QUICK START:

**Just copy and paste this into your browser:**
```
http://localhost:8000/test_projects.html
```

**Or use Incognito mode:**
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + N`
2. Go to `http://localhost:8000/projects.html`

---

## üìä File Verification:

I've verified the fixes are in the file:
- ‚úÖ Only 5 `<article class="project-card">` tags found
- ‚úÖ "Project 3" is now "IoT Smart Energy Meter" (not OpenWISP)
- ‚úÖ No "OpenWISP" text found in file
- ‚úÖ No "View Files" text found in file

**The fixes ARE applied - it's just a browser cache issue!**

---

## üí° Why This Happened:

Browsers cache HTML files to load pages faster. When we updated `projects.html`, your browser kept showing the old cached version instead of loading the new one.
