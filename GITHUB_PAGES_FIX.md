# 🔧 GitHub Pages Deployment Fix

## ✅ What I Fixed

The GitHub Pages build was failing because:
1. **Jekyll was enabled by default** - GitHub tries to build sites with Jekyll
2. **Missing deployment workflow** - No proper static site deployment configured

## 📝 Changes Made

### 1. Created `.nojekyll` file
This tells GitHub Pages NOT to use Jekyll (since your site is pure HTML/CSS/JS).

### 2. Created `.github/workflows/static.yml`
This GitHub Actions workflow properly deploys your static portfolio:
- Runs on every push to `main` branch
- Sets up GitHub Pages
- Uploads your entire site
- Deploys to GitHub Pages

## 🚀 Final Steps - Enable GitHub Pages

### Go to Repository Settings:

1. **Open**: https://github.com/balaji-0212/balaji_s_portfolio/settings/pages

2. **Under "Build and deployment":**
   - Source: Select **"GitHub Actions"** (not "Deploy from a branch")
   
3. **Click Save**

### That's it! The deployment will start automatically.

## ✅ Verify Deployment

1. Go to **Actions** tab: https://github.com/balaji-0212/balaji_s_portfolio/actions
2. You should see a new workflow running: "Deploy Static Portfolio to GitHub Pages"
3. Wait for it to complete (green checkmark)
4. Your site will be live at: **https://balaji-0212.github.io/balaji_s_portfolio/**

## 📊 What the Workflow Does

```yaml
Trigger: Push to main branch
  ↓
Build Job:
  - Checkout code
  - Setup Pages
  - Upload entire site as artifact
  ↓
Deploy Job:
  - Deploy to GitHub Pages
  - Generate site URL
```

## 🎯 Expected Result

After enabling GitHub Actions:
- ✅ Build status: **Success** (green checkmark)
- ✅ Deploy status: **Success** (green checkmark)
- ✅ Site live at: `https://balaji-0212.github.io/balaji_s_portfolio/`

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If deployment still fails:

1. **Check repository settings:**
   - Go to Settings → Pages
   - Ensure "Source" is set to "GitHub Actions"

2. **Check Actions permissions:**
   - Go to Settings → Actions → General
   - Ensure "Read and write permissions" is enabled

3. **Re-run the workflow:**
   - Go to Actions tab
   - Click on the failed workflow
   - Click "Re-run jobs"

## 📱 Test Your Live Site

Once deployed, test these URLs:
- Home: `https://balaji-0212.github.io/balaji_s_portfolio/`
- About: `https://balaji-0212.github.io/balaji_s_portfolio/about.html`
- Projects: `https://balaji-0212.github.io/balaji_s_portfolio/projects.html`
- Certificates: `https://balaji-0212.github.io/balaji_s_portfolio/certificates.html`
- Resume: `https://balaji-0212.github.io/balaji_s_portfolio/resume.html`
- Contact: `https://balaji-0212.github.io/balaji_s_portfolio/contact.html`

## 🎉 Success Indicators

You'll know it worked when:
1. ✅ Actions tab shows green checkmark
2. ✅ Pages settings shows: "Your site is live at..."
3. ✅ Visiting the URL shows your portfolio
4. ✅ All navigation works
5. ✅ All pages load correctly
