# 🎉 CONGRATULATIONS! Your Portfolio is LIVE!

## ✅ GitHub Pages is Working!

Your site is now accessible at:
**https://balaji-0212.github.io/balaji_s_portfolio/**

I can see the page loaded successfully in your screenshot! 🎊

## 🔧 IoT Output Page Fixed

### What Was Wrong:
- The Output page showed only a placeholder message
- No images were displayed
- Users couldn't see the actual hardware photos

### What I Added:
✅ **Image Gallery** with 5 hardware photos:
- 3 hardware setup photos (IMG_4674.JPG, IMG_4675.JPG, IMG_4676.JPG)
- 2 energy distribution charts (Pie chart.jpg, Pie chart 1.jpg)

✅ **Lightbox Functionality**:
- Click any image to view full size
- Close with X button, ESC key, or click outside
- Smooth animations and transitions

✅ **Professional Layout**:
- Grid display for images
- Hover effects
- Descriptive captions

### Note About Other Files:
- `.HEIC` and `.MOV` files are excluded by `.gitignore` (too large for GitHub)
- Only JPG images are displayed (5 images total)
- This keeps the repository size manageable
