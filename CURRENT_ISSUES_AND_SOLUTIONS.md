# Portfolio Issues - Current Status

## ‚ùå PROBLEMS STILL PRESENT (User Confirmed):

### 1. Hero Section Layout Broken
- **Issue:** Text "Balaji S - Data Analyst and Electronics Engineer" appears at bottom right with strange border
- **Expected:** Text should be on left side, image on right side in a 2-column grid
- **Likely Cause:** CSS grid not working OR JavaScript animation conflict

### 2. Projects Page Empty
- **Issue:** No project cards showing on projects.html page
- **Expected:** 6 project cards should display with images
- **Likely Cause:** JavaScript/AOS animation library issue OR CSS display:none

### 3. Profile Photo Not Showing
- **Issue:** Profile placeholder SVG not displaying in hero section
- **Expected:** Profile image should show on right side of hero
- **Likely Cause:** SVG file path issue OR image not loading

### 4. Certificates Too Small
- **Issue:** Certificate images appear too small in lightbox
- **Status:** CSS fix applied but not tested yet

---

## ‚úÖ FIXES ALREADY APPLIED:

1. **Updated project image paths** in index.html and projects.html
2. **Created profile-placeholder.svg** with proper design
3. **Fixed lightbox CSS** for larger certificate display
4. **Added image fallback** with onerror handlers

---

## üîç ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:

Based on the symptoms, the main issues are likely:

### Issue 1: GSAP/AOS Animation Libraries
- The CSP (Content Security Policy) error you mentioned suggests JavaScript issues
- GSAP animations might be interfering with layout
- AOS might not be initializing, hiding content

### Issue 2: File Path Issues
- You mentioned deleting/renaming files
- This could have broken image references
- Profile SVG might be in wrong location

### Issue 3: CSS Grid Not Working
- Hero section grid layout not displaying correctly
- Possible browser compatibility issue
- Or CSS being overridden by animations

---

## üõ†Ô∏è RECOMMENDED SOLUTIONS:

### Solution 1: Disable Animations Temporarily
To test if animations are causing issues, we should:
1. Comment out GSAP initialization in scripts.js
2. Comment out AOS initialization
3. Test if content appears

### Solution 2: Fix Image Paths
1. Verify profile-placeholder.svg is in correct location
2. Check all project image paths are correct
3. Use browser DevTools Network tab to see failed requests

### Solution 3: Simplify Hero Section
1. Remove complex animations from hero
2. Use simple CSS flexbox instead of grid
3. Test basic layout first
